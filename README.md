# Memory Game
RELEASE

 In a memory game, a matrix consisting of a large number of
smaller boxes will be available, the user’s task will be to
win the game by matching patterns on particular boxes.
When the user clicks one box, it should show its pattern –
if the next box clicked on has a similar pattern, both
boxes should remain flipped and the score should be
added. If the second box flipped does not have a similar
pattern, both boxes should stop showing their pattern.
